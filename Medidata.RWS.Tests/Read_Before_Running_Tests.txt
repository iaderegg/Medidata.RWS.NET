In order for tests to run successfully, the Medidata.RWS assembly must not be installed in the GAC.

To remove it from the GAC:

gacutil /uf Medidata.RWS

After test suite is run, it can be added back:

gacutil /if Medidata.RWS.dll

## .env file
Ensure you have a .env file in your test project root.
